This project is about choosing an area from a Store, in this case the areas are: Perfumería (Perfumery), Farmacia (Pharmacy), Cosméticos (Cosmetics). When you choose an area, the console will generate your turn, when there is already a turn, that area will get a +1, for example: if you choose Perfumería, it will generate "P-1", and if you return and you choose Perfumería again, it will generate "P-2". 

In the file "main.py" you can find the menu and the functions that make the project work, in "numeros.py" you can find the generators and decorators for main.
